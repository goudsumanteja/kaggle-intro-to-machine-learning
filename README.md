# Kaggle – Intro to Machine Learning

This repository documents my work from the Kaggle Learn course **“Intro to Machine Learning”**, focused on applying machine learning techniques using Python on real-world datasets.

## What I Learned
- Exploratory data analysis and feature selection
- Train and validation data splitting
- Decision Tree regression
- Random Forest regression
- Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Understanding underfitting vs overfitting
- End-to-end machine learning workflow

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Learn

## Project Outcome
- Built and validated predictive models
- Improved prediction accuracy by moving from Decision Tree to Random Forest
- Achieved validation MAE of approximately 21,800 using Random Forest models

## Relevance
This project strengthens my foundation in applying machine learning concepts to real-world analytical and business problems and aligns well with data analytics and predictive modeling roles.
